# React + GrapesJS Custom Card (POC)

This is a small proof of concept built with **React** and **GrapesJS**.  
The goal was to create a simple **Custom Card Component** that can be dragged and dropped into the GrapesJS editor, and then customized by editing its traits like image, title, description, and button.
